## Querying Data

To query data from Firebase Data Connect, you can use the `useConnectQuery` hook. This hook will automatically infer the data type from the connector and the query and automtically create a [query key](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/query-keys) for the query.

```tsx
import { useConnectQuery } from "@tanstack-query-firebase/react/data-connect";
import { listMoviesRef } from "@dataconnect/default-connector";

function Component() {
  const { data, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error } = useConnectQuery(
    listMoviesRef()
  );
}
```

### Query options

To leverage the full power of Tanstack Query, you can pass in query options to the `useConnectQuery` hook, for example to refetch the query on a interval:

```tsx
const { data, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error } = useConnectQuery(
  listMoviesRef(),
  {
    refetchInterval: 1000,
  }
);
```

The hook extends the [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useQuery) hook, so you can learn more about the available options by reading the [Tanstack Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useQuery).

### Overriding the query key

To override the query key, you can pass in a custom query key to the `useConnectQuery` hook:

```tsx
const { data, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error } = useConnectQuery(
  getMovieRef({ id: "1" }),
  {
    queryKey: ["movies", "1"],
  }
);
```

Note that overriding the query key could mean your query is no longer synchronized with mutation invalidations or server side rendering pre-fetching.

### Initial data

If your application has already fetched a data from Data Connect, you can instead pass the `QueryResult` instance to the hook. This will instead set the `initialData` option on the hook:

```tsx
// Elsewhere in your application
const movies = await executeQuery(listMoviesRef());

// ...

function Component(props: { movies: QueryResult<ListMoviesData, unknown> }) {
  const { data, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error } = useConnectQuery(
    props.movies
  );
}
```

The hook will immediately have data available, and immediately refetch the data when the component is mounted. This behavior can be contolled by providing a `staleTime` value to the hook or Query Client.

### Metadata

Along with the data, the hook will also return the `ref`, `source`, and `fetchTime` metadata from the query.

```tsx
const { data } = useConnectQuery(listMoviesRef());

console.log(data?.ref);
console.log(data?.source);
console.log(data?.fetchTime);
```
