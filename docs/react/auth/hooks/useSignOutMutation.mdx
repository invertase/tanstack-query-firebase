title: useSignOutMutation
---

The `useSignOutMutation` hook is designed to handle user sign-out using Firebase Authentication. 
It integrates Firebase's `signOut` method with TanStack Queryâ€™s mutation lifecycle for easy state management and error handling.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication Integration**: Simplifies signing out users from Firebase Authentication using Firebase's `signOut` method.
- **Built-in State Management**: Tracks the mutation lifecycle (`idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`).
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Supports `onSuccess`, `onError`, and other TanStack Query mutation options.
- **Type-Safe Handling**: Ensures type safety with TanStack Query and Firebase types.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Firebase, TanStack Query and TanStack Query Firebase packages installed:

```bash
npm install firebase @tanstack/react-query @tanstack-query-firebase/react
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useSignOutMutation } from "./useSignOutMutation";

function SignOutComponent() {
  const { mutate, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error } = useSignOutMutation(auth);

  const handleSignOut = () => {
    mutate(); // Trigger the sign-out mutation
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {isPending && <p>Signing out...</p>}
      {isSuccess && <p>Signed out successfully!</p>}
      {isError && <p>Error: {error?.message}</p>}

      <button onClick={handleSignOut} disabled={isPending}>
        Sign Out
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

`useSignOutMutation(auth, options?)`

### Parameters

- `auth`: The Firebase `Auth` instance used to manage authentication.
- `options` (optional):  
  An object for customizing the mutation behavior. Accepts all options supported by TanStack Query's `useMutation`, such as:
  - `onSuccess`: Callback fired when the mutation succeeds.
  - `onError`: Callback fired when the mutation fails.
  - `onSettled`: Callback fired after the mutation finishes, regardless of success or failure.

For a full list of supported options, see the TanStack Query [useMutation documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation)

### Returns

The hook returns the following properties, provided by TanStack Query's [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation):

- `mutate({ email, password })`: Function to trigger the sign-in mutation with the provided email and password.

```ts
mutate(): void;
```

- `isPending`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation is in progress (alias for `isLoading`).

- `isSuccess`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation has successfully completed.

- `isError`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation has failed.

- `error`:
  The error object, if the mutation failed.

- `data`:
  The result of the mutation, which is typically `undefined` for sign-out operations.

For a complete list of returned properties, see the official TanStack Query [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation) documentation.
