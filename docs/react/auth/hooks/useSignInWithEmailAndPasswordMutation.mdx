title: useSignInWithEmailAndPasswordMutation
---

The `useSignInWithEmailAndPasswordMutation` hook is designed to handle user sign-ins using Firebase Authentication with email and password. 
It integrates Firebase's `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method with TanStack Queryâ€™s mutation lifecycle for easy state management and error handling.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication Integration**: Simplifies signing in with email and password using Firebase's `signInWithEmailAndPassword` method.
- **Built-in State Management**: Tracks the mutation lifecycle (`idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`).
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Supports `onSuccess`, `onError`, and other TanStack Query mutation options.
- **Type-Safe Handling**: Ensures type safety with TanStack Query and Firebase types.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Firebase, TanStack Query and TanStack Query Firebase packages installed:

```bash
npm install firebase @tanstack/react-query @tanstack-query-firebase/react
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useSignInWithEmailAndPasswordMutation } from "./useSignInWithEmailAndPasswordMutation";

function SignInComponent() {
  const { mutate, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error, data } = useSignInWithEmailAndPasswordMutation(auth);

  const handleSignIn = () => {
    const email = "user@example.com";
    const password = "password123";
    mutate({ email, password }); // Trigger the sign-in mutation
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {isPending && <p>Signing in...</p>}
      {isSuccess && <p>Signed in as {data?.user.email}</p>}
      {isError && <p>Error: {error?.message}</p>}

      <button onClick={handleSignIn} disabled={isPending}>
        Sign In
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

`useSignInWithEmailAndPasswordMutation(auth, options?)`

### Parameters

  An object for customizing the mutation behavior. Accepts all options supported by TanStack Query's `useMutation`, such as:
  - `onSuccess`: Callback fired when the mutation succeeds.
  - `onError`: Callback fired when the mutation fails.

### Returns

The hook returns the following properties, provided by TanStack Query's [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation):

- `mutate({ email, password })`: Function to trigger the sign-in mutation with the provided email and password.

```ts
mutate({ email: string, password: string }): void;
```

- `isPending`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation is in progress (alias for `isLoading`).

  Boolean indicating if the mutation has successfully completed.

- `isError`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation has failed.
