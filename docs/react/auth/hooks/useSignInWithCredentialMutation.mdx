title: useSignInWithCredentialMutation
---

The `useSignInWithCredentialMutation` hook is designed to handle user sign-ins using Firebase Authentication credentials, such as Google sign-in credentials. 
It integrates Firebase's `signInWithCredential` method with TanStack Queryâ€™s mutation lifecycle for easy state management and error handling.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication Integration**: Simplifies signing in with any valid Firebase `AuthCredential` (e.g., Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **Built-in State Management**: Tracks the mutation lifecycle (`idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`).
- **Customizable Callbacks**: Supports `onSuccess`, `onError`, and other TanStack Query mutation options.
- **Type-Safe Handling**: Ensures type safety with TanStack Query and Firebase types.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Firebase, TanStack Query and TanStack Query Firebase packages installed:

```bash
npm install firebase @tanstack/react-query @tanstack-query-firebase/react
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useSignInWithCredentialMutation } from "@tanstack-query-firebase/react/auth";
import { GoogleAuthProvider } from "firebase/auth";

const authCredential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential("your-id-token");

function SignInComponent() {
  const { mutate, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error, data } = useSignInWithCredentialMutation(auth, authCredential);

  const handleSignIn = () => {
    mutate(); // Trigger the sign-in mutation
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {isPending && <p>Signing in...</p>}
      {isSuccess && <p>Signed in as {data?.user.email}</p>}
      {isError && <p>Error: {error?.message}</p>}

      <button onClick={handleSignIn} disabled={isPending}>
        Sign In
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

`useSignInWithCredentialMutation(auth, credential, options?)`

### Parameters

- `auth`: The Firebase `Auth` instance used to manage authentication.
- `credential`: An instance of `AuthCredential` (e.g., `GoogleAuthProvider.credential`).
- `options` (optional):  
  An object for customizing the mutation behavior. Accepts all options supported by TanStack Query's `useMutation`, such as:
  - `onSuccess`: Callback fired when the mutation succeeds.
  - `onError`: Callback fired when the mutation fails.
  - `onSettled`: Callback fired after the mutation finishes, regardless of success or failure.

For a full list of supported options, see the TanStack Query [useMutation documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation)

### Returns

The hook returns the following properties, provided by TanStack Query's [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation):

- `mutate`:
  Function to trigger the sign-in mutation with the provided credential.

```ts
mutate(): void;
```

- `isPending`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation is in progress (alias for `isLoading`).

- `isSuccess`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation has successfully completed.

- `isError`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation has failed.

- `error`:
  The error object, if the mutation failed.

- `data`:
  The result of the sign-in, typically containing the authenticated `user` object.

For a complete list of returned properties, see the official TanStack Query [useMutation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/reference/useMutation) documentation.
