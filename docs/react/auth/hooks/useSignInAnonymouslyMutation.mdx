title: useSignInAnonymouslyMutation
---

The `useSignInAnonymouslyMutation` hook provides a simple way to sign in users anonymously using Firebase Authentication.
This hook integrates Firebase’s `signInAnonymously` method with TanStack Query's mutation lifecycle, allowing seamless state management and error handling.

## Features

- `Firebase Authentication Integration`: Allows users to sign in anonymously with Firebase Authentication.
- `Built-in State Management`: Tracks the mutation lifecycle (`idle`, `loading`, `success`, `error`).
- `Customizable Callbacks`: Supports `onSuccess`, `onError`, and other TanStack Query mutation options.
- `Type-Safe Handling`: Ensures only valid data is passed and received from Firebase Authentication.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary Firebase, TanStack Query and TanStack Query Firebase packages installed:

```bash
npm install firebase @tanstack/react-query @tanstack-query-firebase/react
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useSignInAnonymouslyMutation } from "@tanstack-query-firebase/react/auth";

function Component() {
  const { mutate, isPending, isSuccess, isError, error } = useSignInAnonymouslyMutation(auth);

  const handleSignIn = () => {
    mutate(); // Trigger anonymous sign-in
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {isPending && <p>Signing in...</p>}
      {isSuccess && <p>Signed in anonymously!</p>}
      {isError && <p>Error: {error?.message}</p>}

      <button onClick={handleSignIn} disabled={isPending}>
        Sign In Anonymously
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

`useSignInAnonymouslyMutation(auth, options?)`

### Parameters

-`auth`: The Firebase `Auth` instance used to manage authentication.

- `mutate`:
  Function to trigger the mutation(signin anonymously).

```ts
mutate(): void;
```

- `isPending`:
  Boolean indicating if the mutation is in progress (alias for `isLoading`).
